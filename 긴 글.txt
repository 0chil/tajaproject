1.
The Middle
Take a seat right over there, sat on the stairs
Stay or leave, the cabinets are bare and I'm unaware
Of just how we got into this mess, got so aggressive
I know we meant all good intentions

So pull me closer
Why don't you pull me close?
Why don't you come on over?
I can't just let you go
Oh baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?

2.
Faint
I am a little bit of loneliness, a little bit of disregard
Handful of complaints but I can't help the fact
That everyone can see these scars
I am what I want you to want, what I want you to feel

But it's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you
To just believe this is real
So I, let go watching you turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend I'm not
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got

3.
Wolves
In your eyes, there's a heavy blue
One to love and one to lose
Sweet divide, a heavy truth
Water or wine, don't make me choose

I wanna feel the way that we did that summer night
Drunk on a feeling, alone with the stars in the sky
I've been running through the jungle
I've been running with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you

4.
Butterflies And Hurricanes
Change everything you are
And everything you were
Your number has been called
Fights and battles have begun

Revenge will surely come
Your hard times are ahead
Best, You've got to be the best
You've got to change the world
And use this chance to be heard
